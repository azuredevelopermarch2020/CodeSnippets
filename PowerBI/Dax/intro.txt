DAX is a functional language for extending your data model.
    - execution flows with calling different functions.
        ex:
          YTD Sales = TOTALYTD(SUM(FactInternetSales[SalesAmount]),DimDate[FullDateAlternateKey],ALL(DimDate))
            
  -usually used in 
      1. SSAS Tabular Model
      2. Power Pivot
      
Datatypes:
-------------
Integer(8 bytes)
Decimal(floating point)(8 bytes)
Currency
  Currency data type allows values between -922,337,203,685,477.5808 to 922,337,203,685,477.5807 with four decimal digits of fixed               precision.
Datetime
    valid date after jan 1 1990
Boolean
string
binary
      
referencing a calculated columns:
 ------------------
 always refers to current row
 have current row concept
    referencing a calculated column
      ex: 'tablename'[columnname] --quotes can bo ommited if you do not have spaces in table name
                  or
           tablename[columnname]
           
referencing a measure:
----------------------
aggregation over multiple rows.
no need to have a tablename along with column name, not specific to a table

Naming Conventions You should follow for calculated columns and measures:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

measure: [MeasureName] - table name is not required, easily can be moved to another table.
calculated column - 
          [tablename][columnname] - table name is required
          
now the difference:
-------------------
1. use calculated column when you need a column as part of slicer
1. use measure for aggregations(ytd, moving sales, moving averages)
2. calculated column requires memory(do not create it unless you really require it)
2. measures requries CPU(for processing)

AGGREGATION Functions:
------------------------
MIN, MAX, SUM
  EX: SUM(FACTINTERNETSALES[SalesAmount])
      SUM(FACTINTERNETSALES[SalesAmount] * FactInternetSales[TotalProductCost]) //not possible, we have an alternative
      
      //single line comments
      /*
        Multiline comments
      */
