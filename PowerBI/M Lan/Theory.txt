 
Scenerio is
Requirement is to make soultion for multiple customer and depending on customer we have to change server name
 and database name


1) I created one static table in power bi/ getting data from sql server
                 Server name, Database Name, Customer
2) Define a parameter to choose customer name
3) on the basis of parameter value Step1 table filter out (Now having only one row)
4) I create on server name and database name as - ADD as new query
5) for other queries where i need to pass server name and database name dynamically from step 4 I used below code
 
For example :
let
    Source = Sql.Database(""&Server{0}&"",  ""&DWDatabase{0}&"", [Query="......"])
in
                 source

My question: I can do the same thing from this way instead of function.
 Pros and cons of using these different ways.


My Analysis:
-------------
1. you selected only one customer, but what if you need to do the same for multiple customers, will write the same query for each customer?(your logic is specific to the query, not a generic one to all the query whereever you have similar requirement).
2. to avoid the duplicate code and code reusability
3. on top of all these use a function where you need to do same functionality multiple times, with some argument changes.
